Imagine you are shopping in a supermarket. This supermarket sells only four items: lottery tickets, apples, cans of beans, and soda. Lottery tickets cost $2 each, apples cost $0.99 each, cans of beans cost $1.58 each, and sodas cost $1.23 each. You have $5 to start with. At the beginning of your shopping trip, you are offered the opportunity to buy
a lottery ticket for a chance to win $2-$10. You are then sequentially asked whether you want to buy apples, cans of beans, and sodas. If you choose to purchase an item, you are asked to specify the quantity of this product. At the end of your shopping trip, you are provided with a list of products purchased and how much money you have left.
